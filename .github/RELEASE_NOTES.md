**Beta, for testing only.** Expect crashes and missing features.

You need your own Super Smash Bros. Melee disc image. **No game data ships in
these artifacts** — the port reads everything, including its font atlases, from
the image you supply at runtime.

Only **USA revision 2 (NTSC-U 1.02, GALE01)** is supported.

## Downloads

| Platform | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 | `Melee-x86_64.AppImage` | Needs a Vulkan driver. `chmod +x`, then run. |
| Linux x86-64 | `melee-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | Portable directory; run `run.sh`. |
| Windows x86-64 | `Melee-Windows-x86_64.zip` | Extract and run `melee.exe`. Keep the DLLs and `resources/` beside it. |
| Android arm64 | `Melee-Android-arm64.apk` | Release build, signed. Allow install from unknown sources. |

Launch with no arguments to open the launcher and pick a disc, or pass the
image path directly:

```sh
./Melee-x86_64.AppImage /path/to/melee.iso
```

## Changes since v0.1.1-beta

- Fixed disc pointers being used without resolution in the HSD object
  loaders. `HSD_IDGetData` is keyed on the resolved host pointer, but jobj,
  pobj and robj looked up with the raw 32-bit disc slot, so those lookups
  always missed and left child joints and envelope references null.
- Rewrote the AObj animation callback dispatch. It previously guessed at
  four signatures, reading a float out of parameters that hold an integer
  or a pointer and dropping arguments entirely in other cases; it now
  dispatches on the real calling convention.
- Kept MEM1 below 4GB on Windows. The allocator fell back to letting the OS
  place it anywhere, which on 64-bit Windows means above 4GB, and every
  32-bit disc pointer slot into it then truncates.
- `MELEE_BACKEND` pins the graphics backend (`vulkan`, `d3d12`, `null`, ...)
  and the log now records which one a run selected. Thanks to
  @alexscott2718-gif.
- The log is timestamped, records a marker for any frame over 50ms, and
  survives a crash: output is flushed per line, Windows writes
  `melee-pc.log` beside the exe, and a fault logs a backtrace naming the
  module it came from.
- The Windows zip ships a pipeline cache seed, so shaders are not all
  compiled the first time each one is used.

## Changes in v0.1.1-beta

- Fixed a crash in the attract demo. Kirby's and Jigglypuff's multi-jump
  attributes are read straight off the disc, but were decoded in the wrong
  byte order, so the second jump looked up motion state `0x55010000` instead
  of `341` and faulted.
- Fixed the remaining places where a pointer was stashed in a 32-bit field
  and truncated on 64-bit builds: the HSD id table and object heap, the
  sislib text cursor stack, the THP video decoder, and pointer slots in the
  Hyrule Castle, Brinstar, Big Blue and Fountain of Dreams stage state.
- Fixed the Windows build failing to start on a real Windows PC. The zip did
  not ship the Visual C++ runtime that Dawn, dxcompiler, SDL3 and nod import,
  so Windows refused to load it with "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found". Wine
  and Proton supply that runtime themselves, which is why it only broke on
  actual Windows. Those DLLs now ship in the zip, and packaging fails if any
  import is left unresolved.
- The Android APK is now a signed release build rather than a debug build,
  and is named `Melee-Android-arm64.apk`.
- Fixed the Android CI build, which depended on a toolchain path that only
  existed on one machine.

## What works

Boot and opening movie, memory card create/load, title and attract demos, main
menu, VS Mode with character and stage select, 1-P Classic and Adventure to
completion with results saved, Training, Stadium (Target Test, Home-Run
Contest, 10-Man Melee), Trophy gallery, Event Match list, music and sound.

## What does not

Online play with rollback netcode is **not implemented**. All-Star is
unreachable until the roster is unlocked. Widescreen camera and HUD are
incomplete. There is no macOS build: the game code depends on GCC's
`scalar_storage_order`, which Clang does not implement.

## Controls

Arrows = stick, IJKL = C-stick, X = A, Z = B, C = X, V = Y, Q/E = L/R,
Tab = Z, Enter = Start, TFGH = D-pad. Gamepads work through SDL and can be
remapped. **F1** opens the settings overlay.
